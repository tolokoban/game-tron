# XJS against all the boilerplate!
The Javascript for a module is usually stored in a `module.js` file. But because writing some sort of code can be fastidious, toloframework can use a `module.xjs` file to generate Javascript before minification. XJS files are written in a syntax near the JSON one: it is just less restrictive on how you use strings and it allows you to put Javascript comments.

XJS is extensible and you can easily add your own code generators.
For now, we will focus on the builtin generator: __View__.

## XJS View
Writing good code for visual components with data binding can result in lot of unreadable javascript code. View helps you writing such a code in a declarative way. Let's take an example:

<x-widget name="tfw.view.checkbox" $content="Hello world!" />

To create this checkbox component, all you need is a `jsx` file and a `css` file.
